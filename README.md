Matlab and c++ code for projects done in a Digital Image Processing Course.  
The projects include:      
1) Image grayscale and Histogram display. (Project 1 Part 2)  
2) Custom code for Contrast Stretching with saturation cut offs. (Project 1 Part 2)  
3) Custom code for Histrogram Equalization. (Project 1 Part 2)  
4) Image Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Display. (Project 1 Part 1)  
5) Recovering original image by removing a pattern added to image by zeroing out frequencies in Frequency Domain. (Project 1 Part 1)  
6) Application of Simple Averaging Filter in both Spatial and Frequency Domains. (Project 1 Part 1)  
7) Create noisy images by adding uncorrelated Gaussian Noises to images and then Averaging the noisy images to see the affect. (Project 1 Part 3)  
8) SNR relation of image and noise. (Project 1 Part 3)  
9) Removing uncorrelated Gaussian Noises after applying Median Filter. (Project 1 Part 3)  
10) Finding Connected Neighbours, Connected Sets and Image Segmentations. (Project 2 Part 1)  
11) Estimating a Screen's Gamma Value by use of alternating checkerboard and constant grayscale pattern. (Project 2 Part 2)  
12) Gamma Correction of Images.  (Project 2 Part 2)  
13) Principal Component Analysis (PCA), finding Eigenvectors, Projecting sample data onto nth Largest Eigenvectors, Reconstructing original data from Projected data. (Project 2 Part 3)
